## Quick Start

```python
from indian_hft_solution import IndianHFTStrategy
from indian_hft_solution.market_structure import NSEConnector, BSEConnector
from indian_hft_solution.execution import SmartOrderRouter

# Initialize HFT strategy for Indian markets
strategy = IndianHFTStrategy(
    exchanges=['NSE', 'BSE'],
    latency_target='microsecond',
    compliance_mode='SEBI_strict'
)

# Connect to exchanges
nse = NSEConnector(colocation=True)
bse = BSEConnector(colocation=True)

# Setup execution system
router = SmartOrderRouter(exchanges=[nse, bse])

# Run strategy
strategy.run()
```
